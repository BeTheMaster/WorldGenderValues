Tops for the weekly 9.01.2024
===============================

# Top1: Is our "story line" suitable?
 -  Introduction, motivation, hypothesis
 -  Data sources and cleaning
 1. **radar charts** Overview of country characteristics 
    => identifying & selecting questions and countries to dive into
 2. **violine charts** Pointing out distribution shapes and sex diffrences over the course of time
 3. **line charts** Reality check - How good does the opinion of female/Male fit to the reality over the course of time
 -  Discussion and conclusion
=> We have 3 Methods and thus 3 Result

Do we have to stick to the structure:
    1. Method
    2. Method
    3. Method
    1. Result
    2. Result
    3. Result
-- or could we do ---
    1. Method
    1. Result
    2. Method
    2. Result
    3. Method
    3. Result
We would prefor the latter, since our story is building up on the previous steps.

# Top2: We want to look at more countries (5 or 10) than we could display in the 4 pages report.
(git repo will contain everything) 
 - a) We show just the interesting ones in detail and write about the rest [x]
 - b) We focus on 2 max 3 countries... but then it's not a world wide anymore []

# Top3: What do you think of our plot choice?
 - Does they suit the task?
   - **radar**
   - **violine**
   - **line**
 - How could we improve readability?
   - **radar**
   - **violine**
   - **line**
 - Is it more diserable to have complicated plots, that we could stick around explaining longer or simple ones, that could be understood at the first glance?

# Top4: Share github?
  git name to add:
